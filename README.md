# Thanks for visiting my repository!

### I'm Alex. After being laid off from my job last year due to Covid-19, I decided to take an opportunity to attend the Gerogia Tech's Coding Boot Camp for Web Development where I learned to develop using the MERN Stack.
<br>

### Now, after finishing the course, I am looking to jump in to development with both feet and actively seeking employment.
